Class Comms (not a puck)
    - Communicates with central through bluetooth
    - converts movement commands to movements

Class Puck
    - This keeps track of the thetas of the pucks that are next to it
    - Can also keep track of its own x and y
    - Keep track of state of e-magnet

    - Functionality

        - move(float theta)
            - called when it is the mover
            - Moves servo to connect with moved Puck
            - Moves servo to angle theta

        - moved(float x, float y)
            - called when it is moved
            - updates the x, y position

        - toggleElectroMagnet()
            - it does what it says

Class Central extends Puck
    - Stores all x, y, and peripheral id
    - Call localization function

    - Functionality

        - localization()
            - finds relative position of peripherals
            - finds relative angle

        - moveTo(Puck mover, Puck moved)
            - tells mover Puck to call move
            - tells moved Puck to call moved


Flow:
    Human tells comms to move robot forward
    comms tells central to move
    central tells peripheral to move
    peripheral moves
